What it do:
1. Generates the field. So far it filled up with symbols "0".
2. change_field function defined, by changing it you can reassign values that

(it will be useful for taking input from user, or view visual changes)
3. Generate a list, to numerate a columns in alphabetical.
4. Generate a list, to numerate a rows in digital.


Tips for future:
- can to add set_defaults function to put there symbols that will fill field,
maybe var with dimension of field

FIELD_HEIGHT = 10


def generate_field(x=FIELD_WIDTH, y=FIELD_HEIGHT):
    '''Generate field
    '''
    return [[0 for _i in range(x)] for _j in range(y)]
